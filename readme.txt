== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is my context? =

A context helps layout information surrounding teamwork, such as customer support, using a digital workspace. Each workspace gives you the tools to organize information to improve communication and reduce work. For example, teams use contexts for repetitive tasks such as IT and Facility help requests; distribute announcements; or provide the most up to date policies and procedures. Compose notes, upload files, add comments then follow pages for notifications to what matters to you. A Context Map outlines workspaces in parent child hierarchy, using the name of the activity.
